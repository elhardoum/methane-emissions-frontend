## Installing the model

```console
curl -o model_1.h5 <google drive link>
```

This command works on Windows 10 and on Linux (and maybe MacOS?).

## Considerations

Eventually we might want to consider

* offering the offline installation of the model and using it via PyScript or Brython;
* create a desktop app e.g. with Electron or Tauri.
